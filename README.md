# Exnix
Exnix stands for Extended Xv6 uNIX. It aims to expand on XV6, and use it's stable Unix framework to do greater tasks.

# Notes
1. Please try and keep any warnings to a minimum.
2. XV6 has annoying indentation, feel free to program however you like (But please keep it readable!).

The following sources are commonly used when porting Utilities (or some library functions) to Enix.
